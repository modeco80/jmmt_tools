## JMMT tools

Tools to work with files for Jonny Moseley Mad Trix on the PS2.

## The Status Quo

This is an experimental branch for a rewrite of the tools in Rust.

### Why?

Mostly for my sanity, but just to see how it fares out. If this gets traction,

and I end up adding things to this that aren't in the main branch, it will probably

be the main branch.
